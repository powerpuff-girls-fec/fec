## Overview

The Atellier Storefront questions and answers component is a production ready product page component that supports CRUD operations for a mock eCommerce company's quesitons and answers data. I was provided with an API that supported HTTP requests question data. From there, I worked with my team to started this repo from the ground up - everything from client, server, testing, and final design was up to us. 

This component was created without external NPM modules or libraries to implement elements. Features such as image carousels, text highlighting upon search, and form validation were built from scratch using React.
